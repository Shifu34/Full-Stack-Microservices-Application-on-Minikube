# Full-Stack-Microservices-Application-on-Minikube
I will develop a full-stack microservices application with a frontend, backend, and database, including user authentication features (Login, Signup, and Forgot Password). Containerize each module with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes (minikube), and deploy on Minikube to demonstrate a scalable, modular deployment structure.
